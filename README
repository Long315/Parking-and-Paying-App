Project for SOFTENG 750 & COMPSCI 732: Software Development Methodologies

Parking Space Searching and Payment Application on Automobile Platform

Introduction
Basing on the fast development of mobile devices, cross-platform application is dominating
the existing application store nowadays. In our project, we choose to use Appcelerator
Titanium framework to develop a cross-platform application which will use GPS location technique,
appcelerator cloud service and JavaScript language. It could provide a convenient and effective
parking system for mobile phone users. Android and iOS users could use it to fulfill the
searching surrounding parking places and paying for their parking fees.  Each of users has their own
account, the relevant data of users and parking places should be saved at cloud database.
